# move

It's annoying to delete and yank parts of a text just to move it up and down a
bit. There is the `:m[ove]` command but it is quite awkward to use nowadays.
vim-move is a Vim plugin that moves lines and selections in a more visual
manner. Out of the box, the following keys are mapped:

    <A-k>   Move current line/selection up
    <A-j>   Move current line/selection down

The mappings can be prefixed with a count, e.g. `5<C-k>` will move the selection
up by 5 lines.
